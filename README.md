# Chapelizod Visitor Information

Chapelizod is a small village close to Dublin city center in Ireland. With many
historical featues, it is a relativly large tourist attraction compared to 
other similar sized towns in Ireland.

"Chapelizod Visitor Information" is a website that aims to provide information
to potential visitors to the town, so that they may plan their visit. Travel 
information such as bus routes is prvided. The site features photographs of 
historical buildings and places of interest that a tourist may decide they want 
to see. The website provides podcasts that give historical information that 
should make visitors trips more interesting. Social media links to the town 
council are provided that will give up to date information about events in the 
town. Residents of the town could also find some use for the site, perhaps they 
want to discover some of the history of the town or find the latest news on 
events.

The website is also designed to work on smartphones. This will allow any 
visitors who are already in the town use the website on the move, allowing them 
to enjoy their visit more and be reminded of the town's attractions.

## UX
 
Who the website is for. What it is for.

User stories

The main goal of the website is to provide information to anyone interested in 
the town. It should be easy to use, compatible with a wide vareity of devices 
and browsers. Information should be easy to locate & fast to load. The main 
visitors to the site are expected to be tourists.

# UI design

**Color scheme:**

**Layout (desktop):**

The site consists of four pages, styled very similarly to give a consistent 
user experience. The color scheme consists largely of black and white with 
hints of light blue throughout. This scheme was chosen to help portray the 
historical nature of the town. Too many colors could possible take away from 
this. Color is added to the site through the use of photographs and video.

To help guide development, wireframe were produced using the "Pencil" 
wireframing tool. See the section "Technologies Used" for more detailed 
information about Pencil.

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement

It would be preferable to have the option of changing the language of the site 
to accomodate a wide range of languages.

A map feature showing the location of places of interest would be another nice 
and useful feature. Perhaps this feature could tie in with Google maps to 
provide the tourist with spoken directions to the area they want to visit.

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.

Fonts: Tangerine gives a nice historic look for headings
Pathway Gothic One gives an nice historic look but is more readable than Tangerine.

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
