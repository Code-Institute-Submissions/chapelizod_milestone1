###### Background

This website is designed to give visitor to the Chapelizod area of Dublin all 
of the information that they might need in order to enjoy their visit to the 
area to its fullest.

###### Design

Each page consistes of three main sections, a navbar, a central area of content 
and a footer. The navbar is used for navigating the page, it is fully expanded
on devices with large screens, it collapses into a toggle button when on small
devices. The footer contains important information that the site stakeholders
want all vistors to see - social media links, diretions of travel and some
tourist information.

In order to emphasise the historical nature of the town (a key selling point to 
visitors), a minimalist approach was taken. The site is composed mainly of black
and white with color being offered by photographs and viseos.

Wireframes were developed using the Pencil wireframing tool

###### Code explaination

###### Navbar

In Bootstrap 4, navbars have Flexbox functionality by default. The navbar on
this site uses the ml-auto method to position text on navbar. Explain how
navbar auto collapses. The active attribue changes depending on what page is 
selected. Default active behavious is not very noticable so this was changed.
