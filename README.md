###### Background

This website is designed to give visitor to the Chapelizod area of Dublin all 
of the information that they might need in order to enjoy their visit to the 
area to its fullest.

###### Design

In order to emphasise the historical nature of the town (a key selling point to 
visitors), a minimalist approach was taken. The site is composed mainly of black
and white with color being offered by photographs and viseos.

Wireframes were developed using the Pencil wireframing tool
